· encode/decode of semantic representation

· knowledge graph embedding relationships

· auto-recognition of topics and concepts

· information and meaning extraction

· semantic data integration, and

· taxonomies/classification

Therefore given any question, they directly search topics, concepts and association that span across various resources.
